Meet Cline, an AI assistant that can use your **CLI** a**N**d **E**ditor.

Thanks to [Claude 3.5 Sonnet's agentic coding capabilities](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/fed9cc193a14b84131812372d8d5857f8f304c52/Model_Card_Claude_3_Addendum.pdf), Cline can handle complex software development tasks step-by-step. With tools that let him create & edit files, explore large projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), he can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support. Cline can even use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create new tools and extend his own capabilities. While autonomous AI scripts traditionally run in sandboxed environments, this extension provides a human-in-the-loop GUI to approve every file change and terminal command, providing a safe and accessible way to explore the potential of agentic AI.

1. Enter your task and add images to convert mockups into functional apps or fix bugs with screenshots.
2. Cline starts by analyzing your file structure & source code ASTs, running regex searches, and reading relevant files to get up to speed in existing projects. By carefully managing what information is added to context, Cline can provide valuable assistance even for large, complex projects without overwhelming the context window.
3. Once Cline has the information he needs, he can:
    - Create and edit files + monitor linter/compiler errors along the way, letting him proactively fix issues like missing imports and syntax errors on his own.
    - Execute commands directly in your terminal and monitor their output as he works, letting him e.g., react to dev server issues after editing a file.
    - For web development tasks, Cline can launch the site in a headless browser, click, type, scroll, and capture screenshots + console logs, allowing him to fix runtime errors and visual bugs.
4. When a task is completed, Cline will present the result to you with a terminal command like `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html`, which you run with a click of a button.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` shortcut to open the command palette and type "Open In New Tab" to open the extension as a tab in your editor. This lets you use Cline side-by-side with your file explorer, and see how he changes your workspace more clearly.

### Use any API and Model

Cline supports API providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, and GCP Vertex. You can also configure any OpenAI compatible API, or use a local model through LM Studio/Ollama. If you're using OpenRouter, the extension fetches their latest model list, allowing you to use the newest models as soon as they're available.

The extension also keeps track of total tokens and API usage cost for the entire task loop and individual requests, keeping you informed of spend every step of the way.

## Testing

### Running Tests

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for our testing framework. Here are the available test scripts:

-   `npm run test:unit`: Run all unit tests
-   `npm run test:unit:watch`: Run unit tests in watch mode
-   `npm run test:coverage`: Run tests and generate coverage report
-   `npm run test:ci`: Run linting and tests with coverage

### Writing Tests

1. Place test files in `src/__tests__/` directory
2. Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension
3. Use the testing utilities in `src/__tests__/utils/test-utils.ts`

### Coverage

We aim to maintain at least 80% code coverage. The coverage report is generated in the `coverage/` directory.
